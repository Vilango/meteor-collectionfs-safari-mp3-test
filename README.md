https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS/issues/447


Just open the app in Safari and Chrome and klick on "open in tab"

In Safari you get a "Live Broadcast player" - You are not able to jump/ssek in the audio

In Chrome you get a regular audio player and you can jump/seek in the audio via a mouse click.
